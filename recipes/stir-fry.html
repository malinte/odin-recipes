            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Ingredients: Slice 300g of boneless chicken breast (or tofu) into thin strips.
                    Slice 1 small onion and both the red and yellow bell peppers.
                    Chop 150g of broccoli florets and 100g of snap peas.
                    Mince 2 garlic cloves and 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger </li>
                <li>Make the Sauce:
                    In a small bowl, whisk together 60ml soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, 1 tablespoon honey (if using),
                    1 tablespoon rice vinegar, and 100ml water.
                    If you prefer a thicker sauce, mix 1 teaspoon cornstarch with 2 tablespoons
                    of water to make a slurry. Set aside for later.</li>
                <li>Cook the Chicken (or Tofu):Heat 1 tablespoon (15ml) of vegetable oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat.
                    Add the sliced chicken strips and stir-fry for 4-5 minutes until cooked through and lightly browned. If using tofu, cook for 3-4 minutes on each side until golden and crisp.
                    Once cooked, remove the chicken or tofu from the pan and set aside.</li>
                <li>Stir-fry the Vegetables: n the same pan, add the onion, bell peppers, broccoli, and snap peas. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until the vegetables are tender but still crisp.
                    Add the minced garlic and ginger, and stir-fry for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Combine and Add the Sauce:Return the cooked chicken (or tofu) to the pan with the vegetables.
                    Pour the prepared sauce over the stir-fry, stirring to coat everything evenly.
                    If using the cornstarch slurry, add it now to thicken the sauce, stirring until the sauce has thickened slightly, about 1 minute. </li>
                <li>Garnish and Serve: Remove from heat and garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions (optional).
                    Serve immediately over cooked jasmine rice or noodles.</li>
