    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> 
        This Lemon Garlic Butter Shrimp Pasta is a light,
         yet indulgent dish that brings together tender,
          juicy shrimp with perfectly cooked pasta, all coated in a rich,
         buttery sauce infused with garlic and a burst of fresh lemon.
          The shrimp is sautéed until golden and succulent,
         while the pasta absorbs the flavors of the tangy lemon and savory garlic butter.
         A hint of red pepper flakes adds a subtle kick,
          and the fresh parsley brightens the dish with its herbaceous notes. 
        Finished with a sprinkle of Parmesan, this dish strikes the perfect balance between freshness and richness,
        making it a delightful weeknight dinner or a special meal for guests.
