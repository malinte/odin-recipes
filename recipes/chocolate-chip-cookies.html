    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> 
        These chocolate chip cookies are the ultimate indulgence,
         with a perfect blend of textures and flavors.
        They have crispy, golden-brown edges that give way to soft,
         chewy centers, creating a satisfying contrast in every bite.
         The rich, buttery dough is balanced by the sweetness of brown and granulated sugar,
         while the vanilla adds a subtle warmth. Bursting with gooey pockets of melted chocolate chips,
        each cookie offers an irresistible combination of sweetness and richness.
         If you include nuts, they add a delightful crunch, but the cookies are equally divine on their own. 

They're everything you could want in a chocolate chip cookie — comforting, nostalgic, and utterly delicious.

    <h4>Ingridients</h4>
    <h5>24-30 cookies</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>250 g unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>200 g brown sugar (light or dark, depending on preference)</li>
        <li>100 g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract (10 ml)</li>
        <li>375 g all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda (5 g)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder (2.5 g)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt (2.5 g)</li>
        <li>300 g chocolate chips or chopped chocolate (dark or semi-sweet)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Oven:
             Preheat your oven to 175°C (350°F).
             Line baking trays with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. </li>
        <li>Cream Butter and Sugars: In a large bowl,
             cream together the softened butter, brown sugar,
              and granulated sugar until light and fluffy
               (this takes about 3–4 minutes using an electric mixer).</li>
        <li>Add Eggs and Vanilla:
             Beat in the eggs one at a time,
              ensuring each one is fully incorporated.
            Add the vanilla extract and mix well.</li>
        <li>Mix Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl,
             whisk together the flour, baking soda,
              baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:
             Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture,
              mixing just until combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Add Chocolate Chips:
             Stir in the chocolate chips (and nuts, if using)
              until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li>Scoop and Shape:
             Using a cookie scoop or tablespoon,
              drop mounds of dough onto the prepared baking trays,
               spacing them about 5 cm apart. For a thicker cookie,
                slightly chill the dough for about 20 minutes before baking.</li>
        <li>Bake: Bake in the preheated oven for 10–12 minutes or until the edges are golden
             brown and the centers are just set. For a softer texture,
              remove the cookies when they still look slightly underbaked in the center;
               they will continue to firm up as they cool.</li>
        <li>Cool: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes
             before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
